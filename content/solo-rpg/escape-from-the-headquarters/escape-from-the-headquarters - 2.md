# Escape from the Headquarters - 2

```
Scene dice
1d6 -> 3 =  3 => overheard a conversation
```

I was going down the stairs and I suddenly had to stop. There is someone down there, in the next floor.

```
is it an enemy?
͸ + - -  + 0 = -1
No
```

```
Are they escaped hostages?
͸ ͸ - -  + 0 = -2
No
```

```
Are they workers?
- - ͸ -  + 0 = -3
No and one of your aspects is compelled
So... another injustice.
```

It's a senior manager, as it seems. Someone is talking by phone with him. Seems like this guys has something to do with the strong control measures of the company.

```
Stealth
- + + -  + 2 = 2
```

```
perception from the manager
͸ ͸ ͸ ͸  + 0 = 0
```

I duck behind him and I grab his neck just the moment he stops the call.

`Stop right there.`

`What the...!`

`Don't move and you will leave... maybe...`

`Who are you?`

`No, that's my question.`

```
I generate 4 verbs for the answers:
bid
shrug
confirm
enclose
```

`What do you want to know?` -he seems very collaborative, with his life in my hands.

`Have you been part of the hardening of the workers rules?`

`I... I... yeah, well... there is a lot of money involved in this business, and they can produce more anyway... why so much coffee between working hours? Plus I'll get paid a big productivity bonus. You know... techno-ninjas around makes you feel you should be working hard`

`Enough...`

Disgusting. I can't stand this.

```
Ok, if I compel my trouble aspect and kill the guy, I would gain a fate point but then the next scene will have a +1 to the scene dice, making a combat more plausible.
Mm...
Yeah, I'll kill him
```

`Can you free me now?` -the guy is a bit impatient.

`I'll free the workers of this company from you instead`

`What... wait! I can pay you enough for...`

The sound of his neck breaking silences that pitiful mock of a bribe. I know the cameras recorded this. I'll have problems from now on for sure.
