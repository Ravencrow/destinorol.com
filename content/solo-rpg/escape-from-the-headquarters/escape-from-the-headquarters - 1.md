# Escape from the Headquarters - 1

```
Scene check
1d6 -> 2 =  2 -> witness injustice
```

Ok, I have the info. I have deactivated the wifi firewalls, but I have only until dawn to get out of the building. The alarms fired when I copied the info into my head. I was careless. Never again.

I'm crawling for the air conditioning ducts. The cameras can't see my inside the walls, so this seems like the best way to go down until I'm at the street level. It's safe, but slow.

Suddenly I hear something. A group of techno-ninjas are using the force to ask some of the company workers about... me? They don't know me, not even that I'm in the building, and still those stupid mecha-ninjas are hitting them to make them talk.

```
My problem is to not stand injustice, so I'll need to pay a Fate point if I don't want to interfere. But... I'll get one if I do, and Keisuke can't stand injustice.

So let's determine the enemy forces. If I get 1 to 4 in a d6, it will be a minor threat. If I get 5-6, it will be a hard one.
```

```
Enemy forces
1d6 -> 6 =  6
```

```
Ok... a difficult one. Their combat power is the same as mine, so a group of techno-ninjas with 3 attack power, the main aspect "cutting-edge techno-ninja", 3 stress boxes and a 3 consecuence box.
```

I can see from my hiding place 6 of them. This will be tough. But must be done.

`So you are looking for me, eh? Then congrats! You found me!`

I destroy the duct with a flying kick aimed to one of the robots.

```
Flying kick
͸ - + +  + 3 = 4
```

```
Robot defense
+ ͸ ͸ ͸  + 3 = 4
```

```
I spend a fate point (the one I gained U_U) on getting a +2 because I'm a techno-monk!!!
```

```
Do they use a fate point?
+ ͸ + ͸  + 0 = 2
Yes
```

The robots are well connected by wifi. They took advantage of all the different points of view they saw me comming and barely dodged my kick.

```
Robot attack
͸ + - -  + 3 = 2
```

```
My defense
͸ + ͸ -  + 3 = 3
They are out of fate points already
```

The robots start a rain of shurikens, and I start dodging without problem.

```
Electromagnetic pulse!!!
+ ͸ + -  + 6 = 7
```

They are too much, I need to do something. I focus the electronic components of my body and release an electromagnetic pulse that almost deactivate the ninjas, leaving them in different states of stunt.

```
Aspect: half-fried techno-ninjas (2 uses)
```

```
Ninja atack
+ + - ͸  + 3 = 4
```

```
My defense
+ + - +  + 3 = 5
```

The ninjas moves slow, like they are restarting their systems. It's my opportunity.

```
The way of the electronic hand!!!
- - - ͸  + 3 = 0
Mm... ok, I use one of the uses of "half-fried techno-ninjas" to make another roll
```

```
The way of the electronic hand 2.0!!!
+ - - +  + 3 = 3
```

```
Robot's defense
͸ ͸ + ͸  + 3 = 4
And... I use the other use of the aspect to have +2 to the roll
```

They move slow, but they are hard... metallic hard. My punch strikes destroys one of them. Ok... 5 remaining.

```
Robot attack
͸ - ͸ +  + 3 = 3
```

```
My defense
͸ ͸ ͸ +  + 3 = 4
```

They try in tandem to take me down, but they don't even touch me. I know I don't have enough electricity inside to use another pulse but... those computers... maybe this will work.

```
Electronic pulse!!!
͸ ͸ + +  + 4 = 6
```

I dodge another shuriken and jump to the other side of the line of computers. I destroy one of the sides of the wall. I knew I would find the electricity wires here. I break one of the wires and... touch my head with it. It hurts a bit but I can focus on concentrating this electricity and... boom! Another pulse! It will hurt to them more.

```
I recharge the aspect with 2 more uses
```

```
robot attack
͸ - ͸ ͸  + 3 = 2
Yes
```

```
my defense
͸ - + ͸  + 3 = 3
Yes
```

Another shuriken? This guys don't have a very good neural network for sure. They should have learned that won't work agains my reflexes.

```
The way of the electrified electronic hand!!!
+ ͸ ͸ ͸  + 3 = 4
Yes
```

```
robot defense
- - ͸ +  + 3 = 2
Yes
```

It's my opportunity. They are almost totally paralized. I run though them releasing a terrible wave of punches after terrible way of punches. When I stop, they are static behind me. I smile and then all of them explode... I'm pretty sure that fire would make the dragon tatoo in my bald look amazing.

Ok, to the next floor.
