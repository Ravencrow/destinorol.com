# Escape from the Headquarters - Intro

Escape from the Headquarters is my take on the initiative created by `/u/classictoy`, the owner of the RPG Tips youtube channel. It consists on an initial scene that's used by all the participants. The player has to fill the gaps and then create a game on their own using that initial scene.

The proposed initial scene is:

```
It was only thanks to your close friend’s warning that you could avoid the assault on your [—]. [—] are [—], but you haven’t been noticed yet, thanks to [—]. Your objective: reach [—] before dawn, [—].
```

From that initial scene, I fill the gaps like this:

```
It was only thanks to your close friend's warning that you could avoid the assault on the Headquarters, the main offices building of your enemy corporation. The mecha-ninjas are deadly, but you haven't been noticed yet, thanks to your training at the Temple of the Techno-Hand, in Neo-Tokyo. Your objective: reach the exit of the building before dawn, or the corporative data that you need to steal will be kept in your enemy's hands.
```

We can take some conclusions based on that initial scene:

- we are playing in a cyberpunk setting.
- we are playing in Neo-Tokyo.
- The Headquarters is the name of the corporation that we are fighting and this is their main offices building
- we are here to steal some corporative info
- we are a tecno-monk, a heavily augmented monk trained in hacking and fighting among other things
- only one thing is cooler than a ninja: a mecha-ninja :D

Apart from the tables offered in the pdf of the initiative, I'll use this one for setting the scenes:

```
| 1d6 | Type of scene         |
|  1  | Resting               |
|  2  | Witness injustice     |  
|  3  | Overhear conversation |  
|  4  | Security measure      |
|  5  | Normal combat         |
|  6  | Difficult combat       |  
```

There is one additional rule for that table: when one of the options is taken, it gains a token. If the option taken has a token, instead of using that option, remove the token and throw the dice again. This way we make easier for other kind of scenes to appear as a result of the d6.

So, let's see how it goes.
