# Escape from the Headquarters - 3

```
Scene check
1d6+1 -> 7 =  7
Difficult combat
```

Ok, I'm about to get out of here. Just one more floor...

`I knew I would find you here, Keisuke-kun`

`Seiichi...` -I didn't expect him here.

Seiichi was my best friend... until he got captured by The Headquarters and turned into this: the master of all the techno-ninjas. He was redone with metal and wrath. He is not my friend anymore. He is a monster. And is on my way out of this building, with some techno-ninjas alongside him.

`Where do you think you go with that info, Keisuke?`

`What info, Seiichi?` -I try to smile, but didn't work out with my ex-best-friend in front of me.

`That one you got into your head. Don't make me open it to take the info back.`

`I think it's the only way you will get that info back to your evil bosses, my friend`

`I'm not your friend anymore! Take him!`

```
Tech-fu!
͸ ͸ + +  + 3 = 5
```

```
Robots defense
- ͸ ͸ -  + 1 = -1
No
```

The techno-ninjas jumps over me but I disappear from their sight. Right, left, up, down, I'm everywhere. At the end, I appear in front of Seiichi. The techno-ninjas turn around, with the intention to jump again. Fools. They are already destroyed.

Then, the explosion came.

`Ah, Keisuke, the fire makes the dragon tattooed in your head look great` -he smiles.

`I know...` -I adopt a fighting stance- `Now, let me get out of here or you will be the next one`

`Just try!` -he starts the fight.

A couple of shurikens shots from nowhere.

```
Shurikens!!!!
- - + ͸  + 3 = 2
Yes
```

```
Defense
͸ ͸ + +  + 3 = 5
Yes
```

`I don't want to kill you, Seiichi!!!` -I warn him after dodging the 2 shurikens with very precise and small movements.

```
Electromagnetic wave!!!
- + - ͸  + 6 = 5
Aspect: electromagnetism (2 uses)
```

I concentrate electricity on my body and burst it. The technological parts of Seiichi starts malfunctioning, but I can still see the hate in his eyes.

`Let me go, Seiichi! It's not too late!!!`

`Never!!!`

```
Anti-electromagnetism wave!
- ͸ + +  + 4 = 5
The aspect is destroyed
```

Seichii had a self-defense mechanism to counter electromagnetic waves. Fuck. It's the amazing Seiichi after all.

`Your tricks works with low-level techno-clowns like these ones` -he points to the remains of the technoninjas that I just destroyed- `But not with the techno-ninja master, Seiichi! Prepare to die!`

`You wanted it!` -I jump with a flying kick targeting Seiichi's laughing face.

```
Flying kick!
͸ + + ͸  + 3 = 5
Yes
```

```
Seiichi Defense
+ + - ͸  + 3 = 4
Yes
```

Seiichi dodges my flying kick, but I expected that and I counter his dodge with my elbow.

Seiichi spits a bit of... is that blood or hydraulic liquid?

`I shouldn't underestimate you. You are the amazing Keisuke after all.`

```
Will Seiichi attack?
͸ + - -  + 0 = -1
No
```

```
Double ninja image!

```

```

Seiichi... wait... now there are two of them!

`I know only one is real and the other is an illusion` -I try to sound calm.

`Yes... but who is who?`

`I'll find out! Kiaaaaa!!!` -another flying kick

```
Techno-dragon-kick!!!
- ͸ + ͸  + 3 = 3
```

```
Seiichi defense
͸ ͸ - ͸  + 3 = 2
Uses one of the uses of the aspect, so 4
```

My flying kick hits the wrong one and the image disappears.

`Damn it...`

`Yes, wrong Seiichi. Now die!!! Fire sword cut!!!`

```
Fire sword cut!
͸ - - ͸  + 3 = 1
Using the other use of the aspect
```

```
Fire sword cut second try!!!
͸ ͸ ͸ ͸  + 3 = 3
Yes
```

```
My defense
+ + - -  + 3 = 3
Yes
```

Seiichi sword almost hit me but then I notice... it's another illusion! The real Seiichi was hiding on the ceiling all the time and now I know where he is.

```
energy blast!
͸ ͸ - ͸  + 3 = 2
```

```
Seichi defense
+ ͸ ͸ ͸  + 3 = 4
Yes
```

I throw an energy blast to the ceiling and the upper floor goes down over me. After the dust settles a bit, I can see Seiichi, in front of me... in one piece.

`This will last forever, Keisuke. For the old times, give me the info you just stolen and I'll let you escape this time`

I can see some wires over the floor. I grab one and look at my ex-friend.

`Never...` -then I bite the wire.

Using the electricity that's flowing through my bio-mech body, I focus and throw another electromagnetic wave to Seiichi.

```
Electromagnetic wave 2.0!!!
- - - -  + 4 = 0
I use a fate point because I'm a techno-monk used to this kind of attacks.
```

```
Electromagnetic wave 3.0!!!
- - + +  + 4 = 4
And another fate point because being a genius hacker I know how to deal with machines like Seiichi. Total, 6.
The aspect: My body is electromagnetic now, baby! (2 uses)
```

`Die already!` -he prepares his laser-katana to perform a powerful iaido attack as he moves.

```
Iaido laser attack!
- ͸ ͸ +  + 3 = 3
```

```
Defense with the bare hands
- + + -  + 3 = 3
```

He slashes with the laser-katana and I grab the laser edge between my own palms. Charged with electro-magnetic energy, I barely feel the heat.

```
Katana-destructrion-move!
͸ - - +  + 3 = 2
```

```
Seiichi defense!
+ + + -  + 3 = 5
```

I try to do a move to destroy his laser katana, but Seiichi is not stupid and takes advantage of my desperate move to turn the tides and hit my shoulder with his edge.

`I'm no rookie, Keisuke. You will die at this rate`

```
Will Seiichi attack?
+ + - ͸  + 0 = 1
```

```
Laser-slash!!!
+ ͸ + ͸  + 3 = 5
With his impulse, 7
```

```
My defense
- - + ͸  + 3 = 2
```

He runs through me, sword in hand, and I feel the laser edge cutting through my body. The regeneration systems can't barely keep me in one piece. I fall over one knee, spitting flood mixed with ante-freeze liquid.

`Give me the info, you will die here if you don't Keisuke` -he is walking, getting closer to me. But he made a big mistake. He run through me, leaving me between him and the door. It's my chance!

```
Run like no tomorrow!
- ͸ - -  + 2 = -1
I'm a techno-monk, my mechanical legs allowing me spend a fate point to repeat the dice
```

```
Run, Keisuke, run!
+ ͸ - +  + 2 = 3
Yes
```

```
Seiichi tries to catch me!
͸ + ͸ -  + 2 = 2
He uses the fate point from the GM to add 2, with a total of 4.
I spend my last use of electromagnetic energy through my body, with a total of 5.
```

Seiichi realizes his attack leave him far from the door than me, and he sees me running through the door.

`Noooooooooooo!!!` -he starts to run at an incredible speed, using his legs servos.

I don't say anything. I try to use all my breath in the sprint. My legs starts to release pressure in the form of steam as I run faster and faster. I loose an arm in the process. I didn't realise it was catch in the terrible attack from before. Then I jump through the door, using my head to destroy the bullet-proof glass. I can almost hear the dragon of my tattoo roaring while the glasses ravage my skin.

Once I'm on the outside, my systems can connect to the network again, and the info is release to my comrades. I don't stop running even when I realize Seiichi stopped in the door, knowing that getting me is useless now. The info has been stolen for good.

I know this is not the last time I meet him. I'll get you back somehow, Seiichi. Just wait.
